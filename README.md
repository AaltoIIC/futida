# Fuzzy Scripts

Fuzzy Scripts for Testing Fuzzy Modeling Method

## Description
This project is created for testing the fuzzy data modeling method presented in Tuomas Keski-Heikkilä's master's [thesis](http://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi:aalto-202109059012).

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
For running this project Pthon 3.X is required. Install the required packages by running 
    '''pip install -r requirements.txt'''

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.
